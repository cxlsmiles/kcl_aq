%% Meta-data block
%% ---------------
%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.
%%
%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already
%% assigned an affiliation.
%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".
%%
%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

\caption{Partial cross sections and charge transfer time extracted from Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_cl}. The blue and red curves are obtained by integrating the area of the 2p$^{-2}$ and 2p$^{-2}$4p final states ($^1$D state region only) at each photon energy step. From these curves we determine the charge transfer time $\tau_{\texttt{CT}}$ according to the formula $\tau_{\texttt{CT}} = \tau l/d$, with $\tau$ being the Cl 1s core-hole lifetime and $l/d$ being the intensity ratio of the localized (2p$^{-2}$ 4p) and delocalized (2p$^{-2}$) states at a given excitation energy \cite{foehlisch05:373}.  The green line defines the Cl$^{-}_{\texttt{aq}}$(1s) ionization potential.}
